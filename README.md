# Sprint2-AVS-Project-MVP

Note: March 13, 2021
The Workspace folder includes all files for the functional Node.js site, just like in
the homeworks. The public folder in the workspace holds the site's HTML, CSS, and JS
files.
As of Mar 13, it does not include the necessary files for running the server. If you
wish to do so, simply run 'npm install' in the console in the workspace
folder. After that, 'npm start' should start the server at localhost:3000.
When committing, PLEASE remember to delete the node_modules folder, in order to keep pushes/pulls small. Thank you!
Workspace currently does not include changes from the following branches:
Dan, Haley, Malia, Moses, Trey, Will, htmlcssteam, and master.
Love, Javascript Backend team <3
