# Sprint2-AVS-Project-MVP

Note: March 13, 2021
The Workspace folder includes all files for the functional Node.js site, just like in
the homeworks. The public folder in the workspace holds the site's HTML, CSS, and JS
files.
As of Mar 13, it does not include the necessary files for running the server. If you
wish to do so, simply run 'npm install' in the from the console in the workspace
server. After that, 'npm start' should start the server at localhost:3000.
Workspace currently does not include changes from the following branches:
Dan, Haley, Malia, Moses, Trey, Will, htmlcssteam, and master.
Love, Javascript Backend team <3
